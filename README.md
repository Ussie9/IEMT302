# From this exercise, I learned that Beautiful soup is a wonderful tool for scrapping rich 
# information from a website. I've also practiced few ways of displaying specific info from a 
# website using the tool.
# I've also seen how .gitignore can help hide unnecessary files like the virtual environment
# from your repository
# I used the requirements.txt file to list libraries I'd use on my project
# I learned the importance of an entry point and how the shabang line specified the type of document 
# my project is in
